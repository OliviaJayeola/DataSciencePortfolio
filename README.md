**Fine-tuning LLM’s and evaluating performance - AI research summarisation (researchsummariser)** 

In this project I first created a Python class to webscrape for research papers published within a certain time period then create a df of the text and abstracts from pdfs. 
I then used this data to fine-tune 3 sequence-to-sequence LLM’s in order to find the LLM with the best performance on summarisation, saved this to a file then deployed it. 

    Skills:
    Python object oriented programming 
    Webscraping and understanding how html works
    Clean and well documented programming
    Fine tuning, saving and deployment of pre-trained LLM’s
    Using hugging face and PyTorch 

**AB test using a range of statistical methods**

In this project I analysed user data from an ab test to gain insights. I performed multiple tests mainly to practice using these methods in different programming languages. This project also includes a full presentation.

    Skills:
    Bayesian inference
    Statistical analysis
    Analysing and interpreting data/critical thinking
    Written communication/presentation skills

    
**Exploratory data analysis and predicting future sales (predict_sales)**

In this project I did an in-depth exploration of data of number of sales from several shops across a ~3 year time series. I started with standard descriptive statistics and time series analysis to find out how to group shops and perform feature engineering. I am currently working on creating several models to forecast future sales, I plan to start with a simple regression model then move onto more complex models/methods such as Bayesian inference and machine learning. 

    Skills:
    Statistical/time series analysis
    Planning data science project: critical and analytical thinking
    Python


**EDA Brain scan**

This project was part of a data programming module during my masters where I got more familiar with data programming in python and SQL. I completed this project **before the introduction of chatgpt** so I developed strong skills and knowledge of pandas, numpy and tensorflow as well as python programming in general. I spent most of this project writing functions for data cleaning and wrangling/feature engineering. I also spent some time learning how to put functions together in tensorflow.

    Skills:
    AI for Computer vision
    Data cleaning and wrangling/feature engineering 
    Python programming/OOP
    Tensorflow programming: subclassing, building deep learning models from scratch, training models

**Document classification using deep learning (NLP_document_classification)**

This project was part of an AI module during my masters where I got familiar with using tensorflow.

    Skills:
    Webscraping and understanding html
    Building deep learning models using tensorflow
    Python 


**Neural network from scratch using matlab (neural_network_matlab)**

This project was part of a neural networks module during my masters where I got familiar with AI theory. I first wrote down the equations/algorithm for a neural network on paper then made this an algorithm on matlab.

    Skills:
    Mathematics for AI/deep learning
    AI theory
    Programming AI algorithm from scratch
    MatLab


**Analysing study data using bayes factor (bayes_factor_R)**

This project was part of a statistics module during my masters where I got familiar with advanced statistical techniques such as bayesian inference. 

    Skills:
    Bayesian inference
    Statistical analysis
    Analysing and interpreting data/critical thinking
    Written communication
