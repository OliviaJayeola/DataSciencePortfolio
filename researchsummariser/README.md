Fine-tuning LLM’s and evaluating performance - AI research summarisation (researchsummariser)

In this project I first created a Python class to webscrape for research papers published within a certain time period then create a df of the text and abstracts from pdfs. I then used this data to fine-tune 3 sequence-to-sequence LLM’s in order to find the LLM with the best performance on summarisation, saved this to a file then deployed it.

Skills:
Python object oriented programming 
Webscraping and understanding how html works
Clean and well documented programming
Fine tuning, saving and deployment of pre-trained LLM’s
Using hugging face and PyTorch
