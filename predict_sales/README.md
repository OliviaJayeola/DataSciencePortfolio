In this project I did an in-depth exploration of data of number of sales from several shops across a ~3 year time series. I started with standard descriptive statistics and time series analysis to find out how to group shops and perform feature engineering. I am currently working on creating several models to forecast future sales, I plan to start with a simple regression model then move onto more complex models/methods such as Bayesian inference and machine learning.

Skills:
Statistical/time series analysis
Planning data science project: critical and analytical thinking
Python
